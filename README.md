# CREATIONAL PATTERNS

### **FACTORY**

Factory is an object specializing in creating other objects.  
It encapsulates object creation.

### **ABSTRACT FACTORY**

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### **SINGLETON**

Global variable in an object-oriented way.

The Borg pattern (also known as the Monostate pattern) is a way to implement singleton behavior, but instead of having only one instance of a class, there are multiple instances that share the same state.

### **BUILDER**

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.

### **PROTOTYPE**

Creating many identical objects individually is expensive in terms of computing power. Good alternative - cloning, because it makes a copy in the memory space instead of building individual objects respectively, from scratch the usual way.
Create a prototypical instance first, clone it whenever you need the replica
